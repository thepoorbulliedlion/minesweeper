      Minesweeper is a logic game, with the objective of clearing the map of the
      "mines"(orange squares). Left click to reveal a square, and right click to
      flag squares you believe to be mines. Revealed squares show how many mines
      are touching it in a one square radius, diagonals included. If the square
      has zero mines on it, the game conveniently auto-reveals all squares
      touching it.
      <br />
      <h1>DISCLAIMER</h1>
      This game is not yet responsive, which means it's not meant to played on
      mobile. The first "reveal" of a square is also random as of now.
